##Providence half marathon '22 review

Date - May 1st 2022
Distance - 21.1k
Time - 1:58:27

I will be dividing this post into 2 sections and 2 parts in each section.

#Training and Nutrition

**What went well**
- Setting the date for the race months in advance gave me a target to work for.
- Well planned and executed to the best of my ability in spite of hectic schedule.
- Three runs per week (1 speed run + 1 long run + 1 recovery run) was great
  with enough room for flexibility and also put in some good work.
- 200 miles over 4 months is my personal best and covering an average of 50 miles
  per month was great.
- Was eating clean for most part.  

**What could have been done better**
- Didn't take recovery seriously. Missed 2 mobility/yoga sessions per week for many weeks.
- Injury kind of derailed the plan and I might have rushed the comeback a little.
- Not taking hydration and post workout nutrition very seriously.
- Was using worn out shoes, which might have lead to injury.


#RaceDay

**What went well**
- Pre race nutrition was great - Oatmeal with Banana and honey, PB sandwich. Two
  to three hours before the race.
- Race itself was fantastic. Was in a flow state as soon as the race started.
- Not concentrating too much on the pace and time helped me run better overall.
  It might have affected negatively but I wasn't really looking for a great time
  in this race.


**What could have been done better**
- Should have pooped well and eaten a light dinner on previous night.
- Shorts were uncomfortable and not helping my run.
- Phone armband was new and untested, caused chafing.
- Post race nutrition should have been handled better. Keeping everything handy.
- Post race recovery could have been better too
