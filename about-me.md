Hello!

I am Namruth, I am graduate student in cybersecurity at Northeastern University, Boston!

I am passionate about building security products, tools and processes. 

I developed this passion for security while I was working at [McAfee](https://www.mcafee.com/) as a software engineer. 
I was mainly involved in the endpoint security business unit working on a whitelisting based solution called [McAfee Application and Change Control](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/application-change-control.html)  

I love running and have been running for the last 5 years.

I watch and play all kinds of sports (read: jack of all, master of none)

I can talk about the NBA all day!üèÄ

I have also served as the President of [Rock the Talk toastmasters club](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/05843268-rock-the-talk). 

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/namruth-reddy/) or my email - namruth@outlook.com

Have a great day!
